abstract: <b><i>Research project participated @ CUHK-Shenzhen RAIL.</i></b>  My final year project proposed a control framework for manipulator grasping objects under base disturbance. However, the success rate is limited due to a lack of confidence evaluation of object motion prediction. This project aims to fill this gap by introducing confidence analysis. Plus, we are pursuing a physical demonstration with a real robot.
